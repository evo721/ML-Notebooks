# ML-Notebooks
Through Google CoLab High-RAM notebooks, used HuggingFace to create ML pipelines for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models such as 2-1 and inpainting.
My initial github profile "will-mrtr" got removed from the proper orgs and my commit history got wiped, these two notebooks were on there.
